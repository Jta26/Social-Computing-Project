# Social Computing Project (Pitt MSIS 2019)

### "Is there a better way to share information regarding cookies that help both the users that are accepting the cookies, and the companies that are sending them?"

This project was created for social computing class as a design/engineering approach to see if there is a better way to give users more control over their information that is shared with companies online. At the same time we would like to discover whether there is a way for the companies given tracking cookies to get more valuable and targeted information.
